## Description

An online e-commerce shop developed to sell luxury yachts, and other sea-vessels! React front-end, a GraphQL, Node.js and Express.js server, and a MongoDB and Mongoose ODM for the database.

Queries and mutations are used for retrieving, adding, updating and deleting data.

## Goals

Our e-commerce site provides a one-stop-shop for all luxury yacht aficionados! A mock-shopping site with a very functional React based interface, which displays new products, allows users to add and remove to their cart, and has a clean, modern UI.

## Installation 

Once user is ready to install, clone the repo and run:

`npm i`


## Future_Development

Further updates to the Cart feature with the implementation of Stripe.

PWA design considerations.
